This is a software created by Kimi and I to log foreign exchange transactions.
We will begin with a simple desktop java application with a GUI to allow us entering transacation data manually. The screenshot image need to be saved to the local machine.

Future development (order does not matter):
1. Change to mobile end application or web application?
2. Automatically drag data and image from the fx website?
3. Diffrent user can have their own account to login.

Setup development environment:
#. Checkout the project from github to some local folder
#. Install and open Eclipse, and create work space in some other folder
#. Import existing git project
#. Setup formatter and save action
